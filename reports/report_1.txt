Starting Journaling Session at:2025-10-27 11:52:31.823605
Following the directive established in my previous journaling session, my objective for this entry is to meticulously log the changes I have implemented within the Python code. As indicated by the provided commit message, I will be detailing these modifications comprehensively during this session.I continued my work on streamlining our journaling process by performing a minor cleanup on the `Makefile`. After having implemented the new `start_session` and `end_session` targets and modified the `report` target, I noticed that the `Makefile` contained some excessive blank lines, specifically a block of five blank lines after the `flash` target's conditional compilation block and another before the `end_session` target. My goal was to make the `Makefile` more readable and organized as it evolved with these new session management features.

I achieved this by simply using my text editor to remove these redundant blank lines. This resulted in a more compact and visually cleaner `Makefile`. While this was a purely cosmetic change, I learned that maintaining good file hygiene, even with build scripts, is crucial for long-term project maintainability and ease of understanding, especially as we introduce new functionalities like our journaling sessions. This small effort contributes to the overall clarity and robustness of our build system, making it easier for any team member to navigate and use. My immediate next steps are to perform comprehensive testing of the newly integrated session management system to ensure all targets function flawlessly, and I will also consider if any further structural improvements to the `Makefile` would be beneficial for clarity.Ending Journaling Session at:2025-10-27 11:59:44.920912

I have concluded this journaling session after refining our `Makefile` by removing unnecessary blank lines to enhance its readability and maintain proper file hygiene as I introduce new session management features. This was a small, cosmetic change, but I learned the importance of keeping even build scripts clean for long-term project maintainability. Considering the progress I've made on getting all report generating files to work on Windows, as detailed in my commit, my goal for the next session will be to distribute these files to the team for verification and begin porting them to the hardware repository.
