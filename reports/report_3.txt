Building upon my ongoing efforts to distribute the report-generating files to the team for verification and initiate their porting to the hardware repository, I identified a critical foundational step. My goal for this session is to get something displayed on our screen, a necessary action to confirm the basic operability of the hardware system to which our tools will eventually be ported.To achieve this, I began by attempting to compile the provided `src/main.c` to generate the firmware. During the `make build` process, I consistently encountered a `fatal error: hardware/interp.h: No such file or directory`. This was an issue I had previously noted, and the comment within the file reflected this ongoing problem. As I continued to investigate the compilation errors, I also identified that the `st7789_lcd.pio.h` header file was similarly missing, leading to an identical 'No such file or directory' error. My modification to `src/main.c` was to update the comments, specifically adding a note about the `st7789_lcd.pio.h` file, to accurately reflect both the known and newly identified missing header files. This documentation step is crucial for tracking the compilation blockers, as resolving these include errors is the immediate next step towards successfully building the firmware required to test our screen's functionality.still trying to fix that it cannot find these files, I continued to examine the output of the `make build` process more closely. As I had previously noted the `fatal error: hardware/interp.h: No such file or directory`, I saw that an identical issue was occurring for `st7789_lcd.pio.h`. To accurately document both compilation blockers, I added a new comment block next to the `#include "st7789_lcd.pio.h"` line in `src/main.c`. This comment specifically highlights the "cannot open source file" error I was seeing, mirroring the existing note for `hardware/interp.h`. My goal in making this change was purely to keep an accurate record of all blocking include errors, as resolving these is fundamental to achieving a successful build and subsequently testing the screen's functionality.Despite my efforts this session to compile `src/main.c` and document the missing header files, `hardware/interp.h` and `st7789_lcd.pio.h`, I ultimately made no progress towards displaying anything on the screen. I spent the session identifying and accurately documenting these compilation blockers within `src/main.c` to ensure a clear record of the immediate issues. For the next session, my goal is to successfully resolve these `No such file or directory` errors, allowing me to finally build the firmware required for initial screen functionality testing.Ending Journaling Session at:2025-11-02 15:40:42.366305
